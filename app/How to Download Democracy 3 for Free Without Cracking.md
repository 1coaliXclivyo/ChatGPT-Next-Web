It is a game that is flexible, customizable, and diverse, as it allows you to choose from different countries, parties, and policies, and to create your own mods and scenarios. It is a game that is fun, educational, and thought-provoking, as it lets you explore different ideologies, strategies, and outcomes, and to learn from your successes and failures.
