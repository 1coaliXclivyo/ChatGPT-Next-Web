In this article, we will show you how to use some of the main features of Artisan Organic Toolset for SketchUp and give you some tips and tricks to get the most out of it.
  
## Subdivision Surfaces
 
Subdivision surfaces are a way of creating smooth and complex shapes from simple geometry. Artisan has a robust subdivision algorithm that can handle very complex geometry and maintain texture position after subdividing. You can subdivide and smooth selected faces, groups, or components with a single click or use the knife tool to create loops and extrude faces.
 
To use subdivision surfaces in Artisan, you need to select the geometry you want to subdivide and click on the Subdivide and Smooth icon on the toolbar. You can adjust the number of subdivisions and the smoothing level on the dialog box that pops up. You can also crease edges or vertices to create hard edges or use the proxy mode to edit the low-poly version of your model while seeing the subsurface result.
  
## Sculpting Tools
 
Sculpting tools are a way of shaping your model by using virtual brushes that push, pull, pinch, spread, flatten, inflate, deflate, smooth, or jitter the surface. Artisan has a variety of sculpting brushes that you can access from the toolbar or the right-click menu. You can adjust the size, strength, and falloff of the brushes on the dialog box that pops up when you activate a brush.
 
To use sculpting tools in Artisan, you need to select the geometry you want to sculpt and click on one of the sculpting icons on the toolbar. You can then use your mouse to perform strokes on the surface of your model. You can also use the select brush to select faces by performing strokes or the paint brush to paint SketchUp materials on faces using virtual brushstrokes. You can also use the symmetrical sculpting mode to sculpt both sides of your model at once or lock vertices to a user-defined work plane.
  
## Vertex Transformation Tools
 
Vertex transformation tools are a way of manipulating individual vertices or groups of vertices using soft selection and various transformation tools. Artisan has a soft selection feature that allows you to select vertices based on their proximity to a center point and apply a falloff curve to them. You can then use the soft move, rotate, scale, or make planar tools to transform them.
 
To use vertex transformation tools in Artisan, you need to select one or more vertices using the select tool or the soft selection tool. You can then click on one of the transformation icons on the toolbar or use the standard SketchUp move, rotate, scale, or push/pull tools. You can also use the mesh optimization tool to reduce the number of polygons in your model by a given percentage.
