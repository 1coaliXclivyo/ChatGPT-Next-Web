## What is a Construct 2 License File?
 
A Construct 2 license file is a text file named c2license.txt that contains your name, email address and a unique code that verifies your purchase of the software. The license file removes all the free edition limits, such as:
 
- A maximum of 100 events in a project
- A maximum of 4 layers in any layout
- A maximum of 2 effects in a project
- No folder organisation in the project bar
- No event search
- No configurations bar
- No Families
- No Preview on LAN
- Not allowed to be used for commercial purposes

With a license file, you can also access exclusive features and updates that are only available for licensed users.
 
## How to Get a Construct 2 License File Legally?
 
There are two ways to get a Construct 2 license file legally: buying from Scirra.com or buying from Steam.
 
### Buying from Scirra.com
 
If you buy from Scirra.com, you can choose between two types of licenses: Personal and Business. The Personal license is suitable for individuals who want to use Construct 2 for personal or educational purposes, or for commercial purposes up to a revenue limit of $5000. The Business license is required for individuals who have already made over $5000 from revenue associated with Construct 2 creations, and for commercial organisations like businesses. The prices are as follows:

| License Type | Price |
| --- | --- |

| Personal | $129.99 |

| Business | $429.99 |

To buy a license from Scirra.com, you need to create an account on the site and then go to the store page. There you can select the license type you want and proceed to checkout. After completing the payment, you will receive an email with a redeem key. This is a special code that you can enter to the Scirra Store and get your license file. You can also download your license file from the store downloads page.
 
### Buying from Steam
 
If you buy from Steam, you don't need a license file at all. Steam will manage the license for you. You just need to install Steam, log in and download Construct 2 from the Steam store. The price is the same as buying from Scirra.com, but you can also take advantage of Steam sales and discounts.
 
## How to Use a Construct 2 License File?
 
If you have a license file from Scirra.com, you need to place it in the installation directory of Construct 2. For example, if you installed Construct 2 in C:\Program Files\Construct 2, then you need to copy the c2license.txt file there. After that, restart Construct 2 and it will detect your license file automatically.
 
If you have any problems with your license file, such as an error message or a corrupted file, you can contact support@scirra.com and they will help you as soon as possible.
 
## Conclusion
 
Construct 2 is a great software for making games without coding, but it requires a valid license file to unlock its full potential. You can get a Construct 2 license file legally by buying from Scirra.com or Steam. Once you have your license file, you can enjoy all the features and benefits of Construct 2 and create amazing games.
